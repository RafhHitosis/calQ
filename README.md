I built this calculator app because I wasn’t satisfied with my phone’s default one, the history feature wasn’t great and didn’t really focus on privacy. This app is simple, lightweight, and gets the job done. It’s not perfect (there might be a bug or two, like in any app), but feel free to try it out, just please don’t claim it as your own.
